# This script demonstrates how to link a field in the table to an entire
# record from another table (sometimes called a "lookup table").  This
# script is different from 'lookup_field_test.rb' because it shows how to
# use the "lookup_key" table attribute to make it easier to define a
# Lookup field.

# In the example below, we have a department table.  For each department
# record, the manager field is actually a reference to a record from the
# person table. This allows us to reference the linked person record
# through the manager field.

# Create a person table. Create lookup table first before the table that
# uses the lookup table, so that KirbyBase can take advantage of any
# indexes.  Also, we want to create the lookup table first so that we can
# define a lookup key.  We do this by adding a :Key entry to the field type
# has and assigning true to it's value.

# Create a table.  We are telling KirbyBase that the manager field is
# to be linked to the person table.  Notice that in this example, since we
# want the manager field in this table to be linked to the person_id in the
# person table, which is that table's lookup key field, all we have to
# specify here is the name of the lookup table, :person.
