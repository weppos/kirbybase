# This script demonstrates how to link a field in the table to an entire
# record from another table (i.e. a "one to one" relationship in database
# lingo).

# In the example below, we have a department table.  For each department
# record, the manager field is actually a reference to a record from the
# person table. This allows us to reference the linked person record
# through the manager field.

require 'kirbybase'

db = KirbyBase.new

# To run as a client in a multi-user environment, uncomment next line.
# Also, make sure kbserver.rb is running.
#db = KirbyBase.new do |d|
#    d.connect_type = :client
#    d.host = 'localhost'
#    d.port = 44444
#end

# If tables exists, delete them.

# Create a person table. Create lookup table first before the table that
# uses the lookup table, so that KirbyBase can take advantage of any
# indexes.

# to be linked to the person table.
