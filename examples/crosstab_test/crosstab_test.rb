# This script demonstrates how to use crosstab functionality of a
# KirbyBase result set.  A KirbyBase result set automatically has an
# equivalent transposed array whereby all of the values of a column are
# available.  I call this a crosstab, but I am probably using this term
# incorrectly.  Perhaps the examples below will help explain what I am
# talking about.

# In this example, we have an order table and an order_item table.  Each
# record in the order table represents a customer order.  The order_item
# table holds the detail items for each order. We create a one-to-many link
# between the order table and the order_item table by providing extra
# information about the order.items field when we create the order table.

require 'kirbybase'

db = KirbyBase.new

# To run as a client in a multi-user environment, uncomment next line.
# Also, make sure kbserver.rb is running.
#db = KirbyBase.new do |d|
#    d.connect_type = :client
#    d.host = 'localhost'
#    d.port = 44444
#end

# If tables exists, delete it.
db.drop_table(:order) if db.table_exists?(:order)

# Create an order item table.  This is the child table to the order table.
# Make sure you create the child table BEFORE you create the parent table
# so that KirbyBase can take advantage of any indexes that you have defined.

# Create an order table.  We are telling KirbyBase that the items field is
# to be linked to the order_item table by comparing the order.order_id
# field to the order_item.order_id field.  By specifying :Link_many, we are
# telling KirbyBase to make this a one-to-many link.  The result of this is
# that when you do a select, the items field of the order table is going to
# hold a reference to a ResultSet (i.e. Array) holding all order_item
# records whose order_id field match the order_id field in the order record.

# Print all orders.  Under each order print all items in that order.  Notice
# that we are able to print the total for each order because we have access
# to the entire order_items.total column of the result set.  We don't have
